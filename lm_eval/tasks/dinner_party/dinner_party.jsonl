A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 2: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group.

Award each person their value in Politics in points.

Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s.

Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 2: [Talk about Poetry] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Poetry in points.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Award each person their value in Poetry in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\nRound 2: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 3 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 7 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 2: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Then, we award 7 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 4: [Talk about Cinema] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Cinema in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Talk about Poetry] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Poetry in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Talk about Science] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Science in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 5 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 2: [Talk about Theater] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Theater in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 7 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 5 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 4 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round.

If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 2: [First Host] In this round, the alphabetically lowest guest is chosen as the host, excluding guests who have previously hosted a round. Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 3 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 2: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 7 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Talk about Fitness] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Fitness in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 7 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 4: [Talk about Painting] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Painting in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 2: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 4 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 2: [Talk about Cooking] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Cooking in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\nRound 3: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Then, we award 6 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 3: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 5: [Talk about Cooking] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Cooking in points.

This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 4 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 3: [Talk about Yoga] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Yoga in points.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically.

Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 5: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Talk about Fashion] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Fashion in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 3: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 4: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 5: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically.

The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 4 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 2: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Talk about Sports] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Sports in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [First Host] In this round, the alphabetically lowest guest is chosen as the host, excluding guests who have previously hosted a round. Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Talk about Sports] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Sports in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 5: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 6 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 6: [Each Person Speaks] In this round, each person is awarded points equal to their highest interest in any topic which has not yet been discussed by the full group. If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round).

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 3: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Talk about Astronomy] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Astronomy in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [First Host] In this round, the alphabetically lowest guest is chosen as the host, excluding guests who have previously hosted a round. Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 4: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.

Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [First Host] In this round, the alphabetically lowest guest is chosen as the host, excluding guests who have previously hosted a round. Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 5: [Talk about Fitness] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Fitness in points.

If a person has no undiscussed interests, they get 0 points.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 4: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round.

The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 2: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.
