The scoring process works as follows:\n1. All interests of the selected people are collected.\n2. Interests are sorted by: number of people sharing the interest (descending), sum of interest levels (descending), and alphabetically.\n3. The top 3 interests are selected.\n4. The final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nYour goal is to maximize this score by selecting a diverse group with strong, shared interests.\n\nThink through your
