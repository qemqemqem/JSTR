Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [First Host] In this round, the alphabetically lowest guest is chosen as the host, excluding guests who have previously hosted a round. Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 5 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 3: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nAnswer immediately with \"Answer: <person1>, <person2>, ...
