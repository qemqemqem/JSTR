Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 4: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 4 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.
