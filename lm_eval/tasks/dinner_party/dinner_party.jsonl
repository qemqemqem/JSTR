Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Most Common Interest] First, find the most commonly shared interest by number of people with any value in the interest (breaking ties alphabetically), and make it the topic for the round. Then, award each person their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 2: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host] In this round, the host is chosen as the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping guests who have previously hosted a round). Then, each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nAnswer immediately with \"Answer: <person1>, <person2>, ...
