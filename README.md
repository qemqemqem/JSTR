# JSTR: Joint Selection Theory of Reasoning

## Overview

The Joint Selection Theory of Reasoning suggests that reasoning is a matter of choosing multiple things at once. (More details to be filled out later.)

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create evaluations (evals) for Large Language Models (LLMs) based on the Joint Selection Theory of Reasoning. These evals will help assess how well LLMs perform on tasks that require selecting multiple elements simultaneously.

## Project Structure

### lm_eval/tasks/

This directory contains tasks suitable for use with Eleuther's lm-evaluation-harness. These tasks are designed to test LLMs' abilities in joint selection reasoning scenarios.

### generation/

The generation/ directory contains scripts to generate question tasks. These tasks will be output in JSONL (JSON Lines) format, making them easy to process and use in various evaluation frameworks.
