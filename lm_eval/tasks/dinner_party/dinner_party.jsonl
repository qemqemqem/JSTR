Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Well-Rounded Interests] In this round, each guest gets points based on how close their highest and lowest interest levels are. Each person gets points based on this formula: `max(0, 10 - (highest_score - lowest_score))`, ignoring 0s. A smaller gap means more points, encouraging well-rounded conversationalists.\n\nRound 2: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 5 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 3: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 4 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nDo not think through your answer.
