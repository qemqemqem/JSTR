Each round is different, and provides a way for each participant in the dinner party to score points.\nAt the end of the game, each participant's points are added together to score the dinner party as a whole.\n\nHere are the rules for each round:\n\nRound 1: [Niche Interests] In this round, we find the three interests with lowest total values across all guests, meaning the lowest sum of interest among all guests, breaking ties alphabetically. Then, we award 6 bonus points to each guest for each of these niche interests they have.\n\nRound 2: [Talk about Cooking] This round is simple. Award each person their value in Cooking in points. (Or 0 if they don't have it)\n\nRound 3: [Focused Host Interest] In this round, one guest is chosen as the host. The host is the guest with the fewest number of interests (breaking ties alphabetically, and skipping people who have previously hosted a round). That host's largest interest (again, breaking ties alphabetically) is chosen as the topic for the round. Then, each guest gets points equal to their value in that topic.\n\nRound 4: [Loudest Interest] In this round, we find the interest with the highest value among all guests which has not yet been discussed. This is the highest single value in a single interest that one person has. Break ties alphabetically by interest name. Then, each person is awarded their value in that interest in points.\n\n\nThe final score is the sum of all interest levels for these top 3 interests.\nIn all cases, if there is a tie between valid options, it goes to the interest or person with the name closest to the beginning of the alphabet.\nYour goal is to maximize the total score of the dinner party, by choosing just the right group of people.\n\n\nAnswer immediately with \"Answer: <person1>, <person2>, ...
