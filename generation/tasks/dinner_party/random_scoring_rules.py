"""
A utility for generating random scoring rules for a dinner party game.

In this game, the player must choose 5 dinner party guests from a list of 10. Each guest has some set of interests, like a level 4 interest in cooking, or a level 7 interest in gardening.

The scoring for this game can be randomized, and this file contains utilities for generating random scoring rules.

Typically, scoring rules are applied in multiple rounds of scoring. Different scoring rules can be more or less complex.

Each rule has some selection mechanism for choosing which interests are involved in the scoring. A simple rule might be to always choose sports and cooking, while a more complex rule might choose the top 3 interests of each guest.

Each rule has some scoring mechanism for determining how many points a guest gets. A simple rule might be to add up the interest values for the chosen interest, while a more complex rule might give 1 point for each interest, plus 1 point for each interest that is shared with the host.

Here are some examples of scoring rules:

- (CR1) Each guest gets their top interest value.
- (CR1) Each guest gets their value in cooking interest.
- (CR2) Each guest gets the sum of their top 3 interests.
- (CR2) Each guest gets their second-highest interest value.
- (CR3) The most common interest is chosen among all guests, and each guest gets their value in that interest.
- (CR3) The largest interest value is chosen among all guests, and each guest gets their value in that interest.
- (CR4) The host is chosen as the alphabetically lowest guest, and each guest gets 2 points for each interest they share with the host.
- (CR4) The most common interest is chosen among all guests, excluding interests which have been chosen in previous rounds, and each guest gets their value in that interest. (Round 2 and later only)
